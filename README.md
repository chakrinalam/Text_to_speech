This is a Python Text To Speech program that converts user-input text into speech.

--> I have made my code into two versions.


--> In v1 folder you can access the python file which can just give speech to your text .


--> In v2 folder you can access a much better version of Text to speech code, in this you have many features which I have mentioned in the v2 folder README.md file check that out.
